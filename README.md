Final Project: Machine Learning for Cancelled Classification Targets in Uber data.
Abstract
In this project, we will perform an exploratory analysis of data on Uber transactions in 2024. The goal is to understand the main reasons influencing the cancellation of potential interactions referred to by the user, and to identify the potential for customer satisfaction and driver ratings, and whether these cancellations are directly correlated. The dataset contains information on vehicle types, some pickup locations, reasons for cancellation by customers and drivers, recorded reasons, incomplete trips, and payment methods used by those users. We will use visualization and statistical analysis techniques to analyze this data framework and answer key questions and possible hypotheses. This overview would allow us to classify each reservation ID (record) using a machine learning model, such as a binary classifier (logistic regression or random forest).

Questions & Hypothesis
Is there a correlation between cancellation reasons and customer and driver ratings, and the payment method with the value of the reservation in the Uber app?
Which behaviors or records have the greatest impact on booking cancellations and customer satisfaction?
Is there any variation that influences booking cancellations?
Could an ML classification algorithm be applied that would allow us to predict whether or not a trip reservation will be canceled?
